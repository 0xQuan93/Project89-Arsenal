  - [ ] Create secure data storage solutions
  - [ ] Design server components if needed

## 5. Documentation & Testing

- [ ] **User Documentation**
  - [ ] Create user guides for each component
  - [ ] Write tutorials for common workflows
  - [ ] Design in-app help system

- [ ] **Developer Documentation**
  - [ ] Document APIs and integration points
  - [ ] Create component architecture diagrams
  - [ ] Write contribution guidelines

- [ ] **Test Suite Development**
  - [ ] Build automated tests for core functionality
  - [ ] Create integration tests for component interaction
  - [ ] Implement performance benchmarks

## 6. Additional Components (Future Expansion)

- [ ] **Potential New Components**
  - [ ] Consciousness Pattern Analyzer
  - [ ] Quantum Entanglement Visualizer
  - [ ] Neural Feedback Loop System

## Recommended Approach

Based on current development, the recommended implementation approach is:

1. Each major component (Mind Mirror, Reality Glitcher) exists as a standalone application
2. A shared core library provides common functionality
3. Integration points allow the applications to work together seamlessly
4. A launcher application provides a unified entry point to the suite

This approach gives you the flexibility of independent development while maintaining the coherence of a suite. Users could install just what they need or the complete package.

## Priority Tasks (Next Steps)

1. Complete the Mind Mirror core functionality
2. Enhance the Reality Glitcher UI with final polishing
3. Implement the data exchange protocol between components
4. Create basic packaging for desktop deployment
5. Document the initial API and integration points
