Begin by focusing on your breath, finding a natural rhythm.
As you relax, become aware that at your most fundamental level, you are made of atoms.
These atoms are mostly empty space, with tiny particles moving within them.
These particles themselves are not solid objects, but probability waves of potential.
Feel yourself as these waves of probability and potential, constantly shifting.
You are not a fixed entity, but a dynamic process in constant creation.
At the quantum level, you are connected to everything through the unified field.
There is no true separation between you and the rest of existence.
Experience yourself as both a distinct pattern and an inseparable part of the whole.
You are both a particle and a wave, both individual and universal.
This is your quantum nature, beyond ordinary perception.
