Cosmic Consciousness Meditation

Find a comfortable position and close your eyes. Begin by taking deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth.

With each breath, feel yourself becoming more relaxed, more at ease. Feel the weight of your body against the surface below you.

Now, visualize a point of light at the center of your being. With each breath, this light grows brighter and expands outward.

As the light expands, it begins to dissolve the boundaries of your physical body. Your consciousness starts to extend beyond your physical form.

Imagine your awareness extending outward, first filling the room around you, then the building, then the surrounding area.

Continue to expand your consciousness outward, encompassing your city, your country, the entire planet.

Feel your consciousness expanding further, out into space, embracing the planets, the solar system, the galaxy.

Your consciousness now extends throughout the universe, connecting with all forms of existence, all patterns of energy and matter.

You are one with the cosmic consciousness, the universal mind that permeates all of existence.

Remain in this state of expanded awareness, feeling the interconnectedness of all things.

When you are ready, slowly begin to bring your awareness back to your physical form, while maintaining a sense of connection with the greater cosmos.

Take a deep breath, and when you're ready, open your eyes, bringing this expanded awareness back into your daily life.
