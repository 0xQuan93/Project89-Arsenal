# PROJECT89 PERCEPTION-HACKING SUITE 
 
## Requirements 
 
- Python 3.8 or higher must be installed 
- Python must be in your system PATH 
 
## Running the Applications 
 
There are two launcher scripts available: 
 
1. Run-P89-Suite.bat - Launches the combined suite with both Mind Mirror and Reality Glitcher 
2. Launch-Reality-Glitcher.bat - Directly launches just the Reality Glitcher component 
 
If you're having issues with the Reality Glitcher UI not appearing when using the combined suite, 
try using the dedicated Reality Glitcher launcher instead. 
 
The first time you run either script, it will install all required dependencies. 
This may take a few moments. 
 
## Troubleshooting 
 
If you encounter any issues: 
 
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed 
2. Make sure Python is in your system PATH 
3. Try running the dedicated Reality Glitcher launcher if the UI doesn't appear in the combined suite 
4. Check the output of the launcher for any error messages 
5. If all else fails, try running these commands manually in a terminal: 
   python -m pip install -r combined_requirements.txt 
   python combined_app.py  # For the combined suite
