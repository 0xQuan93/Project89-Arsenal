# PROJECT89 PERCEPTION-HACKING SUITE

The Perception-Hacking Suite is a collection of applications designed for altering your perception of reality. These tools are developed as part of the PROJECT89 initiative to explore the nature of consciousness and reality.

## Components

### Reality Glitcher (v1.0.0)

A sophisticated interface for creating and controlling reality glitches. This cyberpunk-themed application allows you to experience and manipulate different types of perception anomalies.

**Key Features:**
- Reality Status Dashboard with enhanced data visualization
- Advanced Glitch Management System supporting visual, auditory, temporal, spatial, cognitive, and synchronistic glitches
- Enhanced Quantum Fluctuations Graph with glitch-specific visualization effects
- Type-specific glitch visualizations (visual glitches create vibrant effects, temporal glitches generate phase shifts, etc.)
- Mind Mirror integration for consciousness-based reality manipulation
- Real-time monitoring with advanced sensor metrics

**Tech Stack:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Canvas API

**Key Features:**
- Interactive consciousness map
- Neural node visualization
- Thought pattern tracking
- Deep consciousness exploration
- Integration with Reality Glitcher

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, D3.js

## Integration

The Perception-Hacking Suite components are designed to work together, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for reality exploration:

- **Reality Glitcher + Mind Mirror**: Create reality glitches based on your neural patterns and consciousness data. The enhanced quantum fluctuations graph transforms when connected to Mind Mirror data, creating a visual representation of the interface between your consciousness and perceived reality.

- **Mind Mirror + Dream Weaver**: Import your dream patterns into your consciousness map to identify subconscious structures.

- **Synchronicity Detector + Reality Glitcher**: Trigger specific types of synchronicities by generating targeted reality glitches.

- **Dream Weaver + Synchronicity Detector**: Program your dreams to amplify synchronistic events in waking reality.

## Installation

Each component has its own installation instructions. Please refer to the individual README files for detailed setup information.

## Disclaimer

The Perception-Hacking Suite is an art and consciousness exploration project. These applications are not medical devices and make no claims about altering objective reality. Any perceived changes to your reality are subjective experiences resulting from altered perception.
