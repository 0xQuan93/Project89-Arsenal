Breath Awareness Meditation

Sit comfortably with your spine straight. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.

Begin to notice your natural breathing pattern without trying to change it.

Focus your attention on the sensation of breath at your nostrils, feeling the cool air as you inhale and the warm air as you exhale.

If your mind wanders, simply return your focus to your breath with kindness and patience.
