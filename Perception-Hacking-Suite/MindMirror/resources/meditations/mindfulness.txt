Mindfulness Meditation

Find a comfortable seated position and close your eyes. Begin by bringing your attention to your breath.

Notice the sensation of air flowing in and out of your lungs. Feel your chest rise and fall with each breath.

When your mind wanders, gently acknowledge the thought and bring your focus back to your breath.

Continue this practice, cultivating awareness of the present moment without judgment.
