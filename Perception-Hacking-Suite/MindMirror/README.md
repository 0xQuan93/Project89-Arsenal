# MindMirror

MindMirror is a transformative tool for self-reflection, consciousness expansion, and ego dissolution. It provides a mystical interface for exploring the depths of your inner reality.

## Features

- **Self-Reflection**: Gaze into a magical mirror that reflects your true essence and helps you explore your identity beyond surface-level appearances.
- **Consciousness Expansion**: Experience guided meditations that expand your awareness from the physical form to the cosmic level.
- **Ego Dissolution**: Identify and challenge limiting beliefs that constrain your perception of reality.
- **Journal System**: Record dreams, reflections, and insights to track your spiritual journey.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (can be installed via requirements.txt)

### Setup

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame pillow
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xQuan93/Project89-Arsenal
cd "Project89-Arsenal/Perception Hacking Suite/MindMirror"
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
# Run the original version
python main.py

# OR run the enhanced mystical version
python enchanted_mindmirror.py
```

## Usage

### Original MindMirror
The original MindMirror provides a simple console-based interface for the three core modules:
- `self_reflection.py`: Basic GUI for reflection
- `consciousness_expansion.py`: Console-guided meditation
- `ego_dissolution.py`: Belief challenging system

### Enchanted MindMirror
The enhanced version includes:
- A starry cosmic background with twinkling stars
- Animated rippling mirror for self-reflection
- Customizable meditation duration with progress visualization
- Enhanced belief management system
- Dream and reflection journal system

## Customization

The MindMirror can be customized in several ways:
- Add your own meditation scripts in the consciousness expansion module
- Modify the belief questions in the ego dissolution module
- Add custom imagery to the resources/images folder (if using enchanted version)

## Integration with Project89

The MindMirror is designed to be part of the Perception Hacking Suite, working in conjunction with:
- **RealityGlitcher**: For introducing anomalies into your perception
- **DreamWeaver**: For lucid dream induction and programming

## Troubleshooting

- **Tkinter Issues**: If you encounter Tkinter-related errors, ensure you have Tkinter installed with your Python distribution.
- **Resource Folders**: The enchanted version will automatically create necessary resource folders if they don't exist.
- **Display Issues**: For the enchanted version, a minimum display resolution of 1024x768 is recommended.

## Safety Guidelines

- Begin with short meditation sessions (5-10 minutes) before attempting longer durations
- Always approach belief work with gentle curiosity rather than forceful dissolution
- Take breaks between sessions to integrate insights
- If you experience any discomfort, exit the program and ground yourself

Remember that the true power of the MindMirror lies not in the code, but in your willingness to truly see yourself.
