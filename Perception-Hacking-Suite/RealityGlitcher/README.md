## Technical Stack

- React.js frontend
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom cyberpunk UI components
- Integration with perception manipulation APIs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project89-Arsenal.git
cd Project89-Arsenal/Perception-Hacking-Suite/RealityGlitcher
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd reality-glitcher-ui
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Usage Guide

### Creating New Glitches
1. Navigate to the Glitch List panel
2. Click the "+ CREATE" button to generate a new random glitch
3. The glitch list will auto-expand to accommodate new glitches, with scrolling enabled when necessary

### Controlling Glitches
1. Select a glitch from the Glitch List to load it into the Control Panel
2. Use the intensity slider to adjust the glitch strength
3. Click "ACTIVATE" to apply the glitch to the reality matrix
4. Monitor effects in the visualization panel and reality status dashboard

### Safety Protocols
- It's recommended to keep safety protocols ACTIVE during normal operation
- Disabling safety protocols allows for more extreme glitch effects but may lead to unpredictable results
- The system will emit warnings when operating in an unsafe state

## Troubleshooting

### Black Screen on Launch
If you encounter a black screen when launching the application:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify that all CSS files are loading correctly
3. Ensure your browser supports all required features (WebGL, CSS Grid, etc.)
4. Try clearing your browser cache and reloading

### Performance Issues
For optimal performance:
1. Close unnecessary browser tabs and applications
2. Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date
3. Reduce the number of active glitches if experiencing lag

## Integration with Mind Mirror

RealityGlitcher can integrate with the Mind Mirror application to create reality glitches based on your neural patterns and consciousness data.

### How Integration Works

1. **Data Export**: Mind Mirror exports your consciousness data to the `imports/mind_mirror_data.json` file within the RealityGlitcher directory.

2. **Neural Pattern Analysis**: RealityGlitcher analyzes the neural patterns, nodes, and connections in the exported data.

3. **Glitch Generation**: Based on your consciousness data, RealityGlitcher generates personalized glitches that reflect your neural patterns, with glitch types matching the concepts in your mind.

4. **Reality Alteration**: These glitches then affect reality in ways that resonate with your consciousness patterns, creating a feedback loop between your mind and perceived reality.

### Running the Integration Demo

To experience the integration between Mind Mirror and RealityGlitcher:

1. Run Mind Mirror and use the integration feature to export your data
2. Launch the integration demo:
   ```
   cd examples
   python integration_demo.py
   ```
3. Observe how your consciousness patterns influence the reality glitches

### Technical Details

The integration follows these steps:

- Mind Mirror serializes neural pattern data to JSON format
- RealityGlitcher reads this data from the `imports` directory
- Strong neural nodes become the basis for new glitches
- Connection patterns determine glitch complexity and relationships
- Mind Mirror's metadata sets parameters like intensity and persistence

This bidirectional relationship creates a unique feedback loop between your consciousness and reality distortion effects.
