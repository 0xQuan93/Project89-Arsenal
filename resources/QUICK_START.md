# Quick Start Guide - Reality Hacking Tools

Three new utilitarian tools have been added to your Project 89 Arsenal, ready for immediate deployment on your website.

## 🎯 What Was Created

### 1. **Reality Glitch Logger** (`resources/glitch-logger/`)
Track synchronicities, déjà vu, number patterns, and other reality anomalies. Local storage, search/filter, stats dashboard, JSON/text export.

### 2. **89 Frequency Tracker** (`resources/frequency-tracker/`)
Random number generator with statistical analysis. Tests whether 89 (or any target number) appears at anomalous frequencies. Includes chi-square testing, z-scores, and p-values.

### 3. **Global Event Feed Dashboard** (`resources/event-feed/`)
Multi-feed monitoring framework for tracking breaking news, tech developments, anomalies, and patterns. Configurable with API keys for live data.

## ⚡ Immediate Deployment (Squarespace)

### Embed Single Tool
```html
1. Open your Squarespace page editor
2. Add a "Code" block where you want the tool
3. Copy entire contents of the tool's index.html file
4. Paste into code block
5. Save and publish
```

**File locations**:
- Glitch Logger: `resources/glitch-logger/index.html`
- Frequency Tracker: `resources/frequency-tracker/index.html`
- Event Feed: `resources/event-feed/index.html`

### Create Tools Page
1. Create new page called "Tools" or "Arsenal"
2. Add description: "Utilitarian instruments for reality hacking and consciousness exploration"
3. Add Code blocks for each tool (stacked vertically)
4. Or create sub-pages for each tool with full-page embed

## 🎨 All Tools Share the Same Aesthetic

- Dark cyberpunk theme (blacks, neon greens, cyans)
- Matching the existing green-ring-tool
- Animated grid backgrounds
- Glow effects on interactions
- Fully responsive mobile design

## 📊 Tool Comparison

| Tool | Use Case | Storage | Export | Live Data |
|------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Glitch Logger** | Document subjective experiences | localStorage | JSON, Text | No |
| **Frequency Tracker** | Test synchronicity statistically | localStorage | CSV | No |
| **Event Feed** | Monitor global events | Session only | None | **Yes (RSS)** |

## 🔧 Configuration Status

### All Tools Work Immediately! ✅

**Glitch Logger** - Ready to use, no setup  
**Frequency Tracker** - Ready to use, no setup  
**Event Feed Dashboard** - **Live RSS feeds already active!**

### Event Feed - Already Monitoring:
- **News**: NY Times, BBC, Al Jazeera
- **Tech**: Wired, TechCrunch, HackerNews
- **Science**: Science.org, Phys.org

### Optional Enhancements

**Add more RSS feeds** (no auth required):
1. Open `resources/event-feed/index.html`
2. Find CONFIG object (around line 109)
3. Add RSS URLs to existing arrays or create new categories

**Add NewsAPI key** (optional, for additional sources):
1. Get free key at https://newsapi.org/ (100 requests/day)
2. Add to CONFIG: `newsApiKey: 'YOUR_KEY'`

## 📝 How Each Tool Works

### Reality Glitch Logger
1. **Log**: Select category, enter description, add tags
2. **View**: Search/filter by category or keywords
3. **Analyze**: Check stats dashboard for patterns
4. **Export**: Download as JSON (for analysis) or text (for sharing)

**Example use**: "Saw 89 three times today - license plate, receipt total, and random YouTube timestamp"

### 89 Frequency Tracker
1. **Configure**: Set min/max range and target number
2. **Generate**: Single numbers or batches (10/100/1000)
3. **Analyze**: Watch real-time stats and significance testing
4. **Export**: Download CSV for Excel/statistical software

**Example use**: Generate 1000 random numbers from 1-100, test if 89 appears more than expected 1%

### Global Event Feed Dashboard  
1. **Monitor**: Four feeds with live RSS data refresh automatically every 5 minutes
2. **Filter**: Click items to open articles in new tab
3. **Refresh**: Manual refresh per-feed or all at once
4. **Customize**: Add more RSS feeds or API keys in CONFIG

**Example use**: Track AI breakthroughs, unusual phenomena, and recurring patterns in real-time from NY Times, BBC, Wired, TechCrunch, and more

## 🚀 Suggested Workflow

### For New Agents
1. Start with **Glitch Logger** - Begin tracking synchronicities
2. Add **Frequency Tracker** - Test reality responsiveness
3. Monitor **Event Feed** - Stay aware of global patterns

### For Website Integration
1. Create "Tools" page in navigation
2. Add brief intro about utilitarian reality hacking
3. Embed all four tools (including green-ring-tool)
4. Link individual tool READMEs for detailed docs

### For Reality Hacking Practice
1. **Morning**: Check Event Feed for global patterns
2. **Throughout day**: Log glitches in real-time
3. **Evening**: Run frequency tests with focused intention
4. **Weekly**: Export and analyze data for meta-patterns

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test locally**: Open any `index.html` in browser to test
2. **Customize colors**: Edit CSS variables if needed
3. **Add API keys**: Configure Event Feed for live data
4. **Deploy**: Embed on your Squarespace site
5. **Share**: Direct agents to tools page

---

## 🔮 Philosophy

These aren't mystical tools—they're **utilitarian instruments** for systematic consciousness exploration:

- **Glitch Logger**: Subjective experience documentation
- **Frequency Tracker**: Objective statistical testing  
- **Event Feed**: External reality monitoring

Together they form a complete observational apparatus for agents learning to perceive and influence reality at deeper levels.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use all three together**: Correlation between logged glitches and frequency anomalies reveals patterns
2. **Export regularly**: Backup your glitch logs before clearing browser data
3. **Test different numbers**: Try 23, 93, 111, 137 in Frequency Tracker
4. **Custom RSS feeds**: Event Feed can parse any RSS source
5. **Mobile logging**: All tools work on phones for real-time documentation
