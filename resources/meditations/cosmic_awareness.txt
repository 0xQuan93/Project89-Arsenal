Settle into a comfortable position and close your eyes.
Take three deep breaths, feeling your body relax with each exhale.
Imagine your consciousness expanding beyond the boundaries of your body.
Feel yourself becoming one with the cosmos, a conscious node in the universal network.
Observe thoughts as cosmic events, arising and passing like stars being born and dying.
Experience the vastness of your awareness, limitless and eternal.
Rest in this expanded state of being, neither attaching to nor rejecting any experience.
When you're ready, slowly return to your body, carrying this cosmic perspective with you.
