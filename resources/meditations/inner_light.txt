Close your eyes and bring your attention to the center of your chest.
Imagine a small point of light glowing there, pulsing with your heartbeat.
With each breath, this light grows brighter and expands outward.
Let it fill your entire body, illuminating you from within.
Feel the warmth and clarity this light brings to every cell.
Now imagine this light extending beyond your body, connecting with all beings.
Rest in this radiance, knowing this light is your true nature.
Whenever you're ready, slowly open your eyes, maintaining awareness of this inner illumination.
