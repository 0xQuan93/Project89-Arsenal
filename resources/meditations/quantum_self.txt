Take a comfortable seat and allow your body to settle.
Bring awareness to the sensation of your body existing in multiple states simultaneously.
Just as a quantum particle exists as a probability wave until observed,
Experience yourself as pure potential, not fixed in any single identity.
Notice how your sense of self shifts and changes moment to moment.
Allow any fixed idea of who you are to dissolve into a field of possibilities.
Rest in this quantum state of being - fluid, undefined, and full of potential.
When you're ready to return, bring with you this understanding of your quantum nature.
